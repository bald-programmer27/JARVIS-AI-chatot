# JARVIS: An Intelligent AI Chatbot 🚀  

**JARVIS (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System)** is a Python-based AI chatbot designed to assist users through voice commands. This project combines speech recognition, text-to-speech capabilities, multimedia processing, and a dynamic graphical user interface to create an interactive and user-friendly experience.

## 📋 Features
- **Voice Interaction**:  
  - Processes user commands via speech recognition (`speech_recognition`).  
  - Responds using text-to-speech (`pyttsx3`).  

- **Information Retrieval**:  
  - Fetches information from Wikipedia.  
  - Opens popular websites like Google, Instagram, and more.

- **Multimedia Functionality**:  
  - Takes pictures and records videos using OpenCV (`cv2`).  

- **Dynamic GUI**:  
  - Animated microphone icon created with `tkinter` and `PIL`.  

- **Customizable Commands**:  
  - Can be extended to include more functionalities like opening local files or directories.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech.  
  - `speech_recognition` for speech-to-text.  
  - `wikipedia` for fetching information.  
  - `webbrowser` for opening websites.  
  - `os` for system-level operations.  
  - `cv2` for image and video handling.  
  - `tkinter` and `PIL` for GUI development.  
  - `threading` for concurrency.  

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Start JARVIS**: Launch the chatbot, and it will greet the user based on the time of day.  
2. **Give Commands**: Use voice commands to perform tasks like:  
   - Searching Wikipedia.  
   - Opening websites.  
   - Taking a picture or recording a video.  
   - Checking the current time.  
3. **Interactive GUI**: A dynamic microphone animation engages users while interacting.  

## 📂 Project Structure
- **`main.py`**: Contains the core logic for JARVIS.  
- **`me.jpg`**: The image used for the GUI animation.  

## 🎯 Future Enhancements
- Incorporate advanced natural language processing (NLP) for better conversational abilities.  
- Add support for smart home device integration.  
- Expand the GUI with themes and additional interactive elements.
